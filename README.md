# Demystifying COVID-19

### A Closer Look at Variants & Vaccines Skills Lab

## Sponsored by [Callysto](https://www.callysto.ca/)

----------

In this repository you will find the interactive jupyter notebooks that were used during the workshop. There are three notebooks, with each focusing on a different area of COVID-19 knowledge.

The easiest way to use and learn from these notebooks is to setup an account over at [Callysto Hub](https://hub.callysto.ca). Then click [this link](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/hightechu/skills-lab-covid19&branch=main) once you are logged in.

You can also follow [this tutorial](https://www.callysto.ca/2020/04/01/callysto-tech-tips-sharing-our-online-notebooks/) to get the notebooks over to your Callysto Hub. An alternate method includes downloading the files to your computer and uploading them yourself to Callysto Hub. In case you need help with downloading the files, please check the following tutorial over at [wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Download-a-GitHub-Folder). It includes multiple methods of achieving the same goal of downloading the files to your computer. Once you have obtained the files, you can head over to the Callysto Hub and login using either a Microsoft or a Google account. Finally press the upload button and choose the notebook files you had previously obtained.

### Workshop information

We start the workshop with the ```Variants.ipynb``` notebook, where we introduce the biology behind viruses and what a virus variant is. We follow this with a toy example of the central dogma and a visualization to help us see differences in DNA/RNA and protein sequences. Finally we finish by applying this new knowledge to the virus causing COVID-19 (known as SARS-Cov-2 or 2019-nCov).

We follow up this up with the ```Vaccines.ipynb``` notebook. Here we talk in depth about each of the most popular COVID-19 vaccines to date and how you can find scientific articles of them. We also introduce the vaccine types so that you can learn how each vaccine works. The main goal of this notebook is to learn about the vaccine efficacy and how to obtain the publically available data from the vaccine's clinical trials, to educate yourself in how safe and reliable the vaccines really are.

We end the workshop with the ```Spread.ipynb``` notebook. Here you can explore the pandemic using a simple epidemiological model, where you can see the effects of the virus spreading throughout the population and how different variables of the virus might affect its spread. We also added how a vaccine might help in lowering the spread of the virus.
